=== Quick start examples
==== How to dependency to Bucket4j
The Bucket4j is distributed through https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.bucket4j/bucket4j-core[Maven Central].
You need to add the dependency to your project as described below in order to be able to compile and run examples

.Maven dependency
[,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.bucket4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>bucket4j-core</artifactId>
    <version>{revnumber}</version>
</dependency>
----

.Gradle dependency
[source, groovy, subs=attributes+]
----
implementation 'com.bucket4j:bucket4j-core:{revnumber}'
----
NOTE: see https://bucket4j.com/commercial/java8.html[Java compatibility matrix] if you need for build that is compatible with Java 8

==== Limiting the rate of access to REST API
Imagine that you develop yet another social network, and you want to provide REST API for third-party developers.
To protect your system from overloading you want to introduce the following limitation:

> The bucket size is 50 calls (which cannot be exceeded at any given time), with a "refill rate" of 10 calls per second that continually increases tokens in the bucket.
In other words. if the client app averages 10 calls per second, it will never be throttled,
and moreover, the client has overdraft equals to 50 calls which can be used if the average is a little bit higher than 10 calls/sec in a short time period.

Constructing the bucket to satisfy the requirements above is a little bit more complicated than for previous examples,
because we have to deal with overdraft, but it is not rocket science:
[source, java]
----
import io.github.bucket4j.Bucket;

public class ThrottlingFilter implements javax.servlet.Filter {

    private Bucket createNewBucket() {
         return Bucket.builder()
            .addLimit(limit -> limit.capacity(50).refillGreedy(10, Duration.ofSeconds(1)))
            .build();
    }

    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest servletRequest, ServletResponse servletResponse, FilterChain filterChain) throws IOException, ServletException {
        HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) servletRequest;
        HttpSession session = httpRequest.getSession(true);

        String appKey = SecurityUtils.getThirdPartyAppKey();
        Bucket bucket = (Bucket) session.getAttribute("throttler-" + appKey);
        if (bucket == null) {
            bucket = createNewBucket();
            session.setAttribute("throttler-" + appKey, bucket);
        }

        // tryConsume returns false immediately if no tokens available with the bucket
        if (bucket.tryConsume(1)) {
            // the limit is not exceeded
            filterChain.doFilter(servletRequest, servletResponse);
        } else {
            // limit is exceeded
            HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse) servletResponse;
            httpResponse.setContentType("text/plain");
            httpResponse.setStatus(429);
            httpResponse.getWriter().append("Too many requests");
        }
    }

}
----
If you want to provide more information to the end-user about the state of the bucket, then the last fragment of code above can be rewritten in the following way:
[source, java]
----
        HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse) servletResponse;
        ConsumptionProbe probe = bucket.tryConsumeAndReturnRemaining(1);
        if (probe.isConsumed()) {
            // the limit is not exceeded
            httpResponse.setHeader("X-Rate-Limit-Remaining", "" + probe.getRemainingTokens());
            filterChain.doFilter(servletRequest, servletResponse);
        } else {
            // limit is exceeded
            HttpServletResponse httpResponse = (HttpServletResponse) servletResponse;
            httpResponse.setStatus(429);
            httpResponse.setHeader("X-Rate-Limit-Retry-After-Seconds", "" + TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS.toSeconds(probe.getNanosToWaitForRefill()));
            httpResponse.setContentType("text/plain");
            httpResponse.getWriter().append("Too many requests");
        }
----

==== Specifying initial amount of tokens
By default, initial size of the bucket equals capacity.
But sometimes, you may want to have a lesser initial size, for example for the case of cold start in order to prevent denial of service:

[source, java]
----
int initialTokens = 42;
Bucket bucket = Bucket.builder()
    .addLimit(limit -> limit.capacity(1000).refillGreedy(1000, ofHours(1)).initialTokens(initialTokens))
    .build();
----

==== Returning tokens back to bucket
The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensating_transaction[compensating transaction] is one of the obvious use cases when you want to return tokens back to the bucket:
[source, java]
----
Bucket wallet;
...
if (wallet.tryConsume(50)) { // get 50 cents from wallet
    try {
        buyCocaCola();
    } catch(NoCocaColaException e) {
        // return money to wallet
        wallet.addTokens(50);
    }
}
----

==== Customizing time measurement - choosing nanotime time resolution
By default, Bucket4j uses millisecond time resolution, it is the preferred time measurement strategy.
But rarely(for example benchmarking) do you wish the nanosecond precision:
[source, java]
----
Bucket.builder().withNanosecondPrecision()
----
Be very careful to choose this time measurement strategy, because ``System.nanoTime()`` produces inaccurate results,
use this strategy only if the period of bandwidth is too small that millisecond resolution will be undesired.

==== Customizing time measurement -  Specify custom time measurement strategy
You can specify your custom time meter if existing milliseconds or nanotime time meters are not enough for your purposes.
Imagine that you have a clock, which synchronizes its time with other machines in the current cluster,
if you want to use the time provided by this clock instead of time provided by JVM then you can write something like this:

[source, java]
----
public class ClusteredTimeMeter implements TimeMeter {

    @Override
    public long currentTimeNanos() {
        return ClusteredClock.currentTimeMillis() * 1_000_000;
    }

}

Bucket bucket = Bucket.builder()
    .withCustomTimePrecision(new ClusteredTimeMeter())
    .addLimit(limit -> limit.capacity(100).refillGreedy(100, ofMinutes(1)))
    .build();
----

==== Blocking API example
Suppose that you implement consumer of messages from a messaging system and want to process message no fastly then desired rate
[source, java]
----
// define the bucket with capacity 100  and refill 100 tokens per 1 minute
Bucket bucket = Bucket.builder()
    .addLimit(limit -> limit.capacity(100).refillGreedy(100, ofMinutes(1)))
    .build();

// do polling in infinite loop
while (true) {
    List<Message> messages = consumer.poll();
    for (Message message : messages) {
        // Consume a token from the token bucket. If a token is not available this method will block until the refill adds one to the bucket.
        bucket.asBlocking().consume(1);
        process(message);
    }
}
----
