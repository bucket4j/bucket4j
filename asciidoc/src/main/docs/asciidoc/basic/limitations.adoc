=== Technical limitations
In order to provide the best precision, Bucket4j uses integer arithmetic as much as possible, so any internal calculation is limited by bound ``Long.MAX_VALUE``. Library introduces several limits that described further, in order to be sure that calculations will never exceed the bound.

==== Maximum refill rate
Maximum refill rate is limited by ``1 token/ 1 nanosecond``. Following examples of API usage will raise exceptions

[source, java]
----
Bandwidth.simple(2, Duration.ofNanos(1));
----
[source, java]
----
Bandwidth.simple(1001, Duration.ofNanos(1000));
----
[source, java]
----
Bandwidth.simple(1_000_001, Duration.ofMillis(1));
----

==== Limitation for refill period
Bucket4j works with time intervals as the 64-bit number of nanoseconds. So maximum refill period that is possible will be:
[source, java]
----
Duration.ofNanos(Long.MAX_VALUE);
----
Any attempt to specify period longer that limit above will fail with exception. For example the code bellow will failed
[source, java]
----
Bandwidth.simple(42, Duration.ofMinutes(153722867280912930));
