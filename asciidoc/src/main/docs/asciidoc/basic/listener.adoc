=== Listening for bucket events

==== What can be listened
.You can decorate the bucket by listener to track following events:
- When tokens are consumed from a bucket.
- When consumption requests were rejected by the bucket.
- When the thread was parked to wait for tokens refill as a result of interaction with ``BlockingBucket``.
- When the thread was interrupted during the wait for tokens to be refilled as a result of interaction with ``BlockingBucket``.
- When a delayed task was submitted to ``ScheduledExecutorService`` as a result of interaction with ``AsyncScheduledBucket``.

==== Listener API - corner cases
========
**Question:** How many listeners are needed to create an application that uses many buckets?

**Answer:**  it depends:

- If you want to have aggregated statistics for all buckets then create a single listener per application and reuse this listener for all buckets.
- If you want to measure statistics independently per bucket then use a listener per bucket model.
========

========
**Question:** where are methods the listener is invoking in case of distributed usage?

**Answer:** listener always invoked on the client-side, which means that each client JVM will have its independent stat for the same bucket.
========

========
**Question:** Why does bucket invoke the listener on the client-side instead of the server-side in case of distributed scenario? What do I need to do if I need an aggregated stat across the whole cluster?

**Answer:** Because of a planned expansion to non-JVM back-ends such as Redis, MySQL, PostgreSQL.
It is not possible to serialize and invoke listener on this non-java back-ends, so it was decided to invoke listener on the client-side,
to avoid inconsistency between different back-ends in the future.
You can do post-aggregation of monitoring statistics via features built into your monitoring database or via mediator(like StatsD) between your application and the monitoring database.

==== How to attach a listener to a bucket?
The bucket can be decorated by the listener via the ``toListenable`` method.
[source, java]
----
BucketListener listener = new MyListener();

Bucket bucket = Bucket.builder()
                    .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(100, Duration.ofMinutes(1)))
                    .build()
                    .toListenable(listener);

==== Example of integration with Dropwizard metrics-core
`io.github.bucket4j.SimpleBucketListener` is a simple implementation of `io.github.bucket4j.BucketListener` interface that is available out of the box. Below is the example of exposing statistics via Dropwizard Metrics(for Micrometer it should be quite similar):
[source, java]
----
public static Bucket decorateBucketByStatListener(Bucket originalBucket, String bucketName, MetricRegistry registry) {
  SimpleBucketListener stat = new SimpleBucketListener();
  registry.register(name + ".consumed", (Gauge<Long>) stat::getConsumed);
  registry.register(name + ".rejected", (Gauge<Long>) stat::getRejected);
  registry.register(name + ".parkedNanos", (Gauge<Long>) stat::getParkedNanos);
  registry.register(name + ".interrupted", (Gauge<Long>) stat::getInterrupted);
  registry.register(name + ".delayedNanos", (Gauge<Long>) stat::getDelayedNanos);

  return originalBucket.toListenable(stat);
}
