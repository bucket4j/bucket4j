     * Consumes {@code tokens} from bucket ignoring all limits.
     * As a result of this operation amount of tokens in the bucket could become negative.
     *
     * There are two possible reasons to use this method:
     * <ul>
     * <li>An operation with high priority should be executed independently of rate limits, but it should take effect to subsequent operation with bucket.</li>
     * <li>You want to apply custom blocking strategy instead of default which applied on {@code asScheduler().consume(tokens)} </li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param tokens amount of tokens that should be consumed from a bucket.
     *
     * @return
     * the amount of rate limit violation in nanoseconds is calculated in the following way:
     * <ul>
     *     <li><tt>zero</tt> if rate limit was not violated. For example bucket had 5 tokens before invocation of {@code consumeIgnoringRateLimits(2)},
     *     after invocation there are 3 tokens remain in the bucket, since limits were not violated <tt>zero</tt> returned as result.</li>
     *     <li>Positive value which describes the amount of rate limit violation in nanoseconds.
     *     For example, a bucket with a limit of 10 tokens per 1 second, currently has the 2 tokens available, last refill happen 100 milliseconds ago, and {@code consumeIgnoringRateLimits(6)} called.
     *     <tt>300_000_000</tt> will be returned as result and available tokens in the bucket will became <tt>-3</tt>, and any variation of {@code tryConsume...} will not be successful for 400 milliseconds(time required to refill amount of available tokens until 1).

===== replaceConfiguration
[source, java]
----
    /**
     * Replaces configuration of this bucket.
     *
     * <p>
     * The first hard problem of configuration replacement is making decisions on how to propagate available tokens from the bucket with the previous configuration to the bucket with a new configuration.
     * If you don't care about the previous bucket state then use {@link TokensInheritanceStrategy#RESET}.
     * But it becomes a tricky problem when we expect that previous consumption(that has not been compensated by refill yet) should take effect to the bucket with a new configuration.
     * In this case you need to make a choice between {@link TokensInheritanceStrategy#PROPORTIONALLY} and {@link TokensInheritanceStrategy#AS_IS}, read the documentation about both with strong attention.
     *
     * <p> There is another problem when you are choosing {@link TokensInheritanceStrategy#PROPORTIONALLY} and {@link TokensInheritanceStrategy#AS_IS} and the bucket has more than one bandwidth.
     * For example how does replaceConfiguration implementation bind bandwidths to each other in the following example?
     * <pre>
     * <code>
     *     Bucket bucket = Bucket.builder()
     *                       .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(10, Duration.ofSeconds(1)))
     *                       .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(10000, Duration.ofHours(1)))
     *                       .build();
     *     ...
     *     BucketConfiguration newConfiguration = BucketConfiguration.builder()
     *                                               .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(5000, Duration.ofHours(1)))
     *                                               .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(100, Duration.ofSeconds(10)))
     *                                               .build();
     *     bucket.replaceConfiguration(newConfiguration, TokensInheritanceStrategy.AS_IS);
     * </code>
     * </pre>
     * It is obvious that a simple strategy - copying tokens by bandwidth index will not work well in this case, because it highly depends from order.
     * Instead of inventing the backward magic Bucket4j provides to you the ability to deap controll of this process by specifying identifiers for bandwidth,
     * so in case of multiple bandwidth configuratoin replacement code can copy available tokens by bandwidth ID. So it is better to rewrite the code above as following:
     * <pre>
     * <code>
     * Bucket bucket = Bucket.builder()
     *                            .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(10, Duration.ofSeconds(1)).withId("technical-limit"))
     *                            .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(10000, Duration.ofHours(1)).withId("business-limit"))
     *                            .build();
     * ...
     * BucketConfiguration newConfiguration = BucketConfiguration.builder()
     *                            .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(5000, Duration.ofHours(1)).withId("business-limit"))
     *                            .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(100, Duration.ofSeconds(10)).withId("technical-limit"))
     *                            .build();
     * bucket.replaceConfiguration(newConfiguration, TokensInheritanceStrategy.AS_IS);
     * </code>
     * </pre>
     *
     *
     * <p>
 *     There are the following rules for bandwidth identifiers:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>
     *          By default bandwidth has <b>null</b> identifier.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         null value of identifier equals to another null value if and only if there is only one bandwidth with null identifier.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         If an identifier for bandwidth is specified then it must be unique in the bucket. Bucket does not allow to create of several bandwidths with the same ID.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         {@link TokensInheritanceStrategy#RESET} strategy will be applied for tokens migration during config replacement for bandwidth which has no bound bandwidth with the same ID in the previous configuration,
     *         independently of the strategy that was requested.
     *     </li>
     * </ul>
     *

     * @param tokensInheritanceStrategy specifies the rules for inheritance of available tokens
