=== JDBC integrations
General principles to use each JDBC integration:

* Bucket4j authors do not provide create a table for store buckets, you must make the table personally
* You should create a trigger or a scheduler that will clear your bucket storage table since DBMS is not IMDB, and DBMS don't give TTL the opportunity
* You should create a table, which includes the next required columns: BIGINT as a PRIMARY KEY, BYTEA as a state. By default, Bucket4j works with the next structure:

.PostgreSQL
[,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS buckets(id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, state BYTEA);
----

.MySQL
[,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS buckets(id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, state BLOB);
----

==== Configuring custom settings of SQLProxyManager

* Each proxy manager takes `SQLProxyConfiguration` to customize work with database

* To do that, you should use `SQLProxyConfigurationBuilder`, which includes the next parameters:

[source, java]
----
    /**
     * @param clientSideConfig {@link ClientSideConfig} client-side configuration for proxy-manager.
     *                                                 By default, under the hood uses {@link ClientSideConfig#getDefault}
     * @return {@link SQLProxyConfigurationBuilder}
     */
    public SQLProxyConfigurationBuilder addClientSideConfig(ClientSideConfig clientSideConfig) {
        this.clientSideConfig = clientSideConfig;
        return this;
    }

    /**
     * @param tableSettings {@link BucketTableSettings} define a configuration of the table to use as a Buckets store.
     *                                                 By default, under the hood uses {@link BucketTableSettings#getDefault}
     * @return {@link SQLProxyConfigurationBuilder}
     */
    public SQLProxyConfigurationBuilder addTableSettings(BucketTableSettings tableSettings) {
        this.tableSettings = tableSettings;
        return this;
    }
----

==== Overriding table configuration
You can override the names of the columns to set your custom name of columns, to do that, you should use `BucketTableSettings` to set into `SQLProxyConfigurationBuilder` of your JDBC implementation.

* `SQLProxyConfigurationBuilder` Takes `BucketTableSettings` - is the class to define a configuration of the table to use as a buckets store. By default, under the hood uses `BucketTableSettings.getDefault()`

Parameters:

`tableName` - name of table to use as a Buckets store

`idName` - name of id (PRIMARY KEY - BIGINT)

`stateName` - name of state (BYTEA)

By default, uses: "buckets" as a `tableName`; "id" as a `idName`; "state" as a `stateName`

===== addTableSettings
Takes `BucketTableSettings` - See <<Overriding table configuration>>.

===== addClientSideConfig
Takes `ClientSideConfig` - is a client-side configuration for proxy-manager. By default, under the hood uses `ClientSideConfig.getDefault()`


==== PostgreSQL integration
===== Dependencies
To use Bucket4j extension for PostgreSQL you need to add following dependency:
[,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.bucket4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>bucket4j-postgresql</artifactId>
    <version>{revnumber}</version>
</dependency>
----
NOTE: see https://github.com/bucket4j/bucket4j/tree/8.0#java-compatibility-matrix[Java compatibility matrix] if you need for build that is compatible with Java 8

===== Example of Bucket instantiation
----
        Long key = 1L;
        PostgreSQLadvisoryLockBasedProxyManager proxyManager = new PostgreSQLadvisoryLockBasedProxyManager(new SQLProxyConfiguration(dataSource));
        BucketConfiguration bucketConfiguration = BucketConfiguration.builder()
                .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(10, Duration.ofSeconds(1)))
                .build();
        BucketProxy bucket = proxyManager.builder().build(key, bucketConfiguration);
----

* The example of usage `SQLProxyConfigurationBuilder` to customize your setting for the `PostgreSQLadvisoryLockBasedProxyManager`:
----
        SQLProxyConfiguration configuration = SQLProxyConfigurationBuilder.builder()
                .withClientSideConfig(ClientSideConfig.getDefault().withClientClock(TimeMeter.SYSTEM_MILLISECONDS))
                .withTableSettings(BucketTableSettings.customSettings("tableName", "idName", "stateName"))
                .build(dataSource);
        PostgreSQLadvisoryLockBasedProxyManager proxyManager = new PostgreSQLadvisoryLockBasedProxyManager(configuration);
----

===== Strategies of transaction

* Bucket4j is given opportunities to choose in which strategy of transaction work

`PostgreSQLadvisoryLockBasedProxyManager` - Based on pg_advisory_xact_lock locks an application-defined resource, which can be identified either by a single 64-bit key value or two 32-bit key values (note that these two key spaces do not overlap).
If another session already holds a lock on the same resource identifier, this function will wait until the resource becomes available.
The lock is exclusive.
Multiple lock requests stack so that if the same resource is locked three times it must then be unlocked three times to be released for other sessions use.
The lock is automatically released at the end of the current transaction and cannot be released explicitly.

`PostgreSQLSelectForUpdateLockBasedTransactionTest` - Based on Select For Update
This prevents them from being modified or deleted by other transactions until the current transaction ends.
That is, other transactions that attempt UPDATE, DELETE, or SELECT FOR UPDATE of these rows will be blocked until the current transaction ends.
Also, if an UPDATE, DELETE, or SELECT FOR UPDATE from another transaction has already locked a selected row or rows, SELECT FOR UPDATE will wait for the other transaction to complete, and will then lock and return the updated row (or no row, if the row was deleted).
Within a SERIALIZABLE transaction, however, an error will be thrown if a row to be locked has changed since the transaction started.

==== MySQL integration
===== Dependencies
To use Bucket4j extension for MySQL you need to add following dependency:

[,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.bucket4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>bucket4j-mysql</artifactId>
    <version>{revnumber}</version>
</dependency>
----

===== Example of Bucket instantiation

----
        Long key = 1L;
        MySQLSelectForUpdateBasedProxyManager proxyManager = new MySQLSelectForUpdateBasedProxyManager(new SQLProxyConfiguration(dataSource));
        BucketConfiguration bucketConfiguration = BucketConfiguration.builder()
                .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(10, Duration.ofSeconds(1)))
                .build();
        BucketProxy bucket = proxyManager.builder().build(key, bucketConfiguration);
