=== Bucket4j-MongoDB
Bucket4j provides integration with MongoDB database through two modules:
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Module | Async supported | Driver type

|``bucket4j-mongodb-sync``
| No
| Synchronous MongoDB Java Driver

|``bucket4j-mongodb-async``
| Yes
| Reactive Streams MongoDB Java Driver

|===
IMPORTANT: Both modules use Compare&Swap pattern to handle concurrent access to MongoDB. This provides atomic bucket state updates through MongoDB's atomic operations (`insertOne` and `findOneAndReplace`).
